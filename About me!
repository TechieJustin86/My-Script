Justin here.

I wanted a place to share my scripts to people for feedback. And a place to store them. 
My goal in my scripts are to see what I can do and to improve my skills in scripting. I worked in very laruge companys such as collegages and hospitals, to small shops such as banks and networking. I had access to unlimited budjects to picking up pennys from the ground. 

Any feed back is welcomed but I do request a few things from everyone.
1. No negative feedback. Support in improving the script is what I am looking for.
2. I am tollaly aware that there are easier,faster ways (such as 3rd party software free and not) to complete a job that one of my scripts will preform. No need to mention " Oh ou can use this program or that program."
4. My knowedge in scripting are in Powershell and batch. I can read HTML,java,C++ and understand what is going on but i am not profeccent in writing much in them atm.
