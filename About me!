Hi, I'm Justin.

I created this space to share my scripts and gather feedback, as well as to have a place to store them. My main goal with scripting is to challenge myself and improve my skills. I've worked in both large organizations, like colleges and hospitals, as well as smaller businesses, including banks and network operations.

Feedback is always appreciated, but I do have a few requests:

1.  Please keep feedback constructive. I’m looking for support on how to improve my scripts, not negative criticism.
2.  I’m aware there are faster or easier ways to accomplish tasks (like using third-party software, both free and paid). There’s no need to suggest those alternatives.
3.  My scripting experience is primarily in PowerShell and Batch. I can read HTML, Java, and C++, and I understand the basics, but I’m still working on becoming proficient in those languages.


Thanks for your understanding and support!
