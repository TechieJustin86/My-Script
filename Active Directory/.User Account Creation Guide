The User Account Creation PowerShell script pulls information from an Excel sheet. Below, I will explain the purpose of each sheet. At the end of this document, I have listed some ideas and improvements that I am considering.

The ideal of this script is to be able to use this anywhere without modifying the script. Only setting up the Excel file. Whitch sould be static to some degree. 

Important Note:
Each sheet contains a header. Do not modify the header as it aligns with the script's functionality.

My companies OU is setup something like below. 
Wanted to mention this because it is how some of the script is built using this model.

OU=Office1-4,OU=Departments,OU=users,OU=comapny,DC=domain,DC=local
OU=Departments,OU=Office2,OU=Departments,OU=users,OU=comapny,DC=domain,DC=local

Office2 is the main office where the departments are located at.

Sheet: "Job Title Groups"
>  Column A contains "Group#". The "Group#" should increment according to the job title that has the most
    security groups associated with it.
>  The first row lists each job title.

Sheet: "Department Manager"
>  Manager column: This does not need to match the department listed next to it. 
>  The manager's name should go under the "Manager" header, and the department name should be under the         "Department" header.

Sheet: "Department OU"
>  Department column must align with the "OUPath" column.
>  Department names go under the "Department" header, and their corresponding OU paths go under the
    "OUPath" header.

Sheet: "Domain"
>  Adjust the second row as needed but maintain the same format as the original.

Sheet: "Terminated"
>  This sheet is updated by the script "Terminate-UserAndLogToExcel".

Sheet: "Office OU"
>  The "Office" column must align with the "OUPath" column.

Sheet: "Office Location"
>  The "Department" column must match the "Office" column.

Ideas and Improvements:
Remove "Department" header from sheet' " Department Manager, Department OU, Office Location all have an header "Department". and only list it once in the file.
Improve OU mapping in the Excel sheet.
